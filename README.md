# Python Documentation

A collection of project documentation for Python projects I have created

The structure of this repository is as follows:

- Organization
  * Repository
    + Documentation (static site)

Automated pull requests are generated using `hub` after a push to a repository is triggered.
It has the following format: `[PROJECT_NAME]_[DATE]`, where the date format is `YYYY|MM|DD`.
The script used can be found here.
